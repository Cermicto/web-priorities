# About Me
This is just a single page application / website detailing some of my web development experience. It has some _custom CSS animations for page transitions_ and _a 3D CSS header background that's pretty nice on the eyes_. :)
I put it together in day if that says anything about my abilitites as a frontend web developer. Designed from writing code; no UX forethought. I'm in the middle of my UX Design Google Certification at the moment which is giving me a better understanding and skillset of the UX designers I've worked with in the past, which is good.
I'm able to make pretty much anything happen on the frontend and comfortable working with APIs. I also enjoy writing backend code with Node.js.
